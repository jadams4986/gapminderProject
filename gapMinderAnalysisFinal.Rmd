```{r, echo = FALSE}
library( "dplyr" )
```

Here's code to load the file for the countries New Zealand, Sierra Leone, and United States.

```{r}
gap.in <- read.table( "output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE )

gap.subset <- subset( gap.in, country == "United States" | country == "Sierra Leone" | country == "New Zealand" )

gap.subset
```

For each country, we want to plot GDP vs year.

```{r}
countries <- list( "New Zealand", "Sierra Leone", "United States" )

for ( countryCur in countries )
{
  tmp <- gap.subset %>%
    filter( country == countryCur ) 
  
  plot( tmp[[ "year" ]], tmp[[ "gdpPercap" ]],
        pch = 20,
        col = "blue", 
        main = paste( "Year vs. GDP per Capita for", countryCur ), # paste0() adds no space between strings
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = "GDP per Capita", 
        cex = tmp$pop/min(tmp$pop),
        )
}
```

Now we want to calculate the mean, min, and max life expectancies for each continent.

```{r}
tmp <- gap.in %>% 
  select( lifeExp, continent ) %>%
  group_by( continent ) %>%
  summarise( mean = mean( lifeExp ), min = min( lifeExp ), max = max( lifeExp ) )

print( tmp )
```

Now we want to create a histogram of the global life expectancies
